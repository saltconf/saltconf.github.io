          <h2>SALTED: The SALT Equity &amp; Diversity Committee</h2>
            <p>
            SALTED is charged with helping make semantics and pragmatics more
            equitable and diverse. The committee was formed in 2020 and meets
            regularly to discuss and organize initiatives like its SALTED
            Workshop Series. More information is available in
            our <a href="mission.pdf">Mission Statement</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>SALTED has established a SALT Access and Inclusivity Fund. The fund will be used to pay honoraria for SALTED workshops; to fund SALTED Scholarships (see below); and to underwrite sign language translation and other accessibility-related costs at SALT conferences that need it. If you have the means, we would appreciate a contribution from you! We will be accepting donations on a rolling basis over <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home">PayPal</a> (at saltsteering@gmail.com).

             <h2>SALT(ED) Workshop at SALT 31</h2>
              <h3>Workshop on Inclusive Teaching in Semantics</h3>   
            <p>
                The day before the main conference formally began, <a href="https://saltconf.github.io/salt31">SALT 31</a> held a two-hour <a href="https://saltconf.github.io/salt31/workshop.html">satellite workshop</a> for discussing methods for making teaching in Semantics and Pragmatics (focusing on the North American context) more inclusive, with an eye towards welcoming groups currently underrepresented in the subfield. Led by a panel of semanticists and other linguists who have thought deeply about inclusivity in pedagogy, the workshop will concentrate on two areas: (1) making the content of semantics classes more inclusive, including syllabus revisions and example data from a broader range of source languages and language varieties; and (2) making the style of pedagogy more inclusive and welcoming to all students. A portion of the time will be devoted to structured discussions among participants, together and in smaller break-out rooms. The forum will include an optional final hour to facilitate unstructured discussions among attendees.
