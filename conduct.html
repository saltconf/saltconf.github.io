            <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

            <hr>
            
            The following is a Code of Conduct for reviewers and participants of Semantics and Linguistic Theory (SALT), which is dedicated to fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment for all linguists. It describes expected behavior and outlines ways in which the organizers will address problems that arise.

            <hr>
            
            <h3>Unprofessional behavior</h3>

            <p>All conference participants must maintain professional integrity in their relationships and interactions with one another. </p>

            <p>All participants of SALT are subject to the LSA's <a href="https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/lsa-civility-policy">Civility Policy</a> which, among other things, prohibits harassment and prejudice.  “Participant” in this policy refers to anyone present at LSA events, including staff, contractors, vendors, exhibitors, venue staff, LSA members, and all other attendees.</p>
            
            <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination (related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, language, etc.);</li>
                <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following;</li>
                <li>Harassing photography or recording;</li> 
                <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events;</li>
                <li>Inappropriate physical contact;</li>
                <li>Unwelcome sexual attention;</li>
                <li>Advocating for, encouraging, or condoning any of the above behavior</li>

            <hr>

            <h3>Inclusive behavior</h3>
            
            <p>Policies alone cannot eliminate problematic conduct. Accordingly, this Code of Conduct includes an expectation that all participants proactively work to establish a culture of respect in which everyone feels welcomed and valued. To accomplish this, participants are asked to speak up and take action when these values are not adhered to, and recognize that power differences and hierarchies inherent to academia and broader society may inhibit many parties (including students and junior scholars) from feeling free to object to or report problematic behavior (details on reporting below). </p>

            <p>SALT encourages its participants to proactively engage in inclusive behavior, e.g.:
              <ul>
                <li>acknowledge the opinions, skills, and contributions of others;</li>
                <li>give honest feedback to others in a compassionate and respectful manner;</li>
                <li>refrain from disruptive or monopolizing behavior, especially during talks and question periods;</li>
                <li>advocate for others when they are unable to advocate for themselves, or in instances of prejudice or discrimination; and</li>
                <li>provide encouragement, help, support, or mentorship to colleagues when needed.</li>

                </p>
            <hr>
            
            <h3>Reporting</h3>

            <p>Harassment and other violations of the Civility Policy reduce the value of our event for everyone. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, or if you witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the conference organizers as soon as possible. </p>
        
            <p>You can report a violation: 
              <ul>
                <li>in person or over email to a local organizer; </li>
                <li>in an email to the SALT Steering Committee (at <a href="mailto:saltsteering@gmail.com">saltsteering@gmail.com</a>);<li>
                <li>or via the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSco4AZiQir_pkHuwQX_LEIrBkMmq_K778UJds9RG2m9pqEWpQ/viewform">anonymous CoC violation form</a><li>
                </p>
            
            <hr>

            <h3>Enforcement</h3>

            <p>SALT organizers will take action to redress any behavior designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.</p>

            <p>Participants who are reasonably and politely asked by another participant to stop engaging in a particular behavior should comply immediately. Failure to do so could and should result in the filing of a violation report (see above).</p>

            <p>If a participant has a report filed against them, the conference organizers will review the report and will contact the participant so they can consider their version of the incident. The organizers might also consult with the person who filed the report or other people involved in or with knowledge of the incident. </p>

            <p>The organizers will decide, as quickly as possible, the extent to which the behavior reported constitutes a violation of the Code of Conduct. Possible responses include: 
             <ul>
               <li>no response (if the behavior is found to not constitute a violation); </li>
               <li>a warning to the participant that their behavior constitutes a minor violation, but that continued behavior would constitute a major violation; and</li>
               <li>expulsion from the conference and a report of the incident to the following year’s organizers (if the behavior is found to constitute a major violation)</li>
               </p>
