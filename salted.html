          <h2>SALTED: The SALT Equity &amp; Diversity Committee</h2>
            <p>
              SALTED is charged with helping make semantics and pragmatics more equitable and diverse. The committee was formed
              in 2020 and meets regularly to discuss and organize initiatives like its SALTED Workshop Series. Read our Mission Statement <a href="mission.pdf">here</a>.

            <h2>The SALTED Workshop at SALT 32</h2>
            <h3>(Prestige) English as an Object and Meta-Language</h3>
            <p> (Prestige) English has traditionally served both as the object of study and medium of study for formal semantics worldwide. This workshop aims to discuss what issues may arise from this virtual hegemony and explore some alternative approaches. Led by a panel of experts, we will discuss questions such as the following: What impact has the focus on English had on scholars outside of the Anglophone world? What can be done to increase the representation of non-English languages and non-prestige dialects in semantic research, pedagogy, and scholarly publication?
            </p>
