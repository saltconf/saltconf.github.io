          <h2>SALTED: The SALT Equity &amp; Diversity Committee</h2>
            <p>
            SALTED is charged with helping make semantics and pragmatics more
            equitable and diverse. The committee was formed in 2020 and meets
            regularly to discuss and organize initiatives like its SALTED
            Workshop Series. More information is available in
            our <a href="mission.pdf">Mission Statement</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>SALTED has established a SALT Access and Inclusivity Fund. The fund will be used to pay honoraria for SALTED workshops; to fund SALTED Scholarships (see below); and to underwrite sign language translation and other accessibility-related costs at SALT conferences that need it. If you have the means, we would appreciate a contribution from you! We will be accepting donations on a rolling basis over <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home">PayPal</a> (at saltsteering@gmail.com).

            <h2>SALTED Scholarships</h2>
            <h3>Coming Spring 2023!</h3>
            <p>
              SALTED is proud to announce the SALTED Scholarships. We will award at least two or three scholarships per year of at least $200 for travel and registration costs for SALT participants who cannot otherwise afford them. We will allocate scholarships based on need and usefulness (to the applicant and the semantics community), as determined on a case-by-case basis by the SALTED Scholarship Subcommittee. Eligible applicants include undergraduate or graduate students, or SALT participants who are un- or under-employed.

            SALTED is currently chaired by Jessica Rett, and its faculty
            committee members are Ana Aguilar-Guevara, BR George, Valentine
            Hacquard, Ezra Keshet, Mary Maloney, Julia Pozas Loyo, Ai

            <h3>2020-2021</h3>
            <p>
            The inaugural SALTED committee consisted of Jessica Rett (Inaugural
            Chair), Ezra Keshet (Interim Chair), Lucas Champollion, Mitcho
            Erlewine, Valentine Hacquard, and Mary Moroney. Its committee
            membership consists of its chair (the SALT Diversity Coordinator, an
            elected position) and several committee members, chosen by the chair
            and ideally including at least one student, serving staggered
            two-year terms.

            <h3>(Prestige) English as an Object and Meta-Language</h3>
            <p>
            (Prestige) English has traditionally served both as the object
            of study and medium of study for formal semantics worldwide. This
            workshop aims to discuss what issues may arise from this virtual
            hegemony and explore some alternative approaches. Led by a panel of
            experts, we will discuss questions such as the following: What
            impact has the focus on English had on scholars outside of the
            Anglophone world? What can be done to increase the representation of
            non-English languages and non-prestige dialects in semantic
            research, pedagogy, and scholarly publication?
            </p>

            <h3>Inclusive teaching in semantics</h3>
            <p>           The day before the main conference formally begins, SALT will hold a two-hour satellite workshop for discussing methods for making teaching in Semantics and Pragmatics (focusing on the North American context) more inclusive, with an eye towards welcoming groups currently underrepresented in the subfield. Led by a panel of semanticists and other linguists who have thought deeply about inclusivity in pedagogy, the workshop will concentrate on two areas: (1) making the content of semantics classes more inclusive, including syllabus revisions and example data from a broader range of source languages and language varieties; and (2) making the style of pedagogy more inclusive and welcoming to all students. A portion of the time will be devoted to structured discussions among participants, together and in smaller break-out rooms. The forum will include an optional final hour to facilitate unstructured discussions among attendees.</p>
