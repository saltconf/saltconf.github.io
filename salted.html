          <h2>SALTED: The SALT Equity &amp; Diversity Committee</h2>
            <p>
              SALTED is charged with helping make semantics and pragmatics more equitable and diverse. The committee was formed
              in 2020 and meets regularly to discuss and organize initiatives like its SALTED Workshop Series. Read our Mission Statement <a href="mission.pdf">here</a>.

            <h2>Membership</h2>
            <p>
              The inaugural SALTED committee consisted of Jessica Rett (Inaugural Chair), Ezra Keshet (Interim Chair), 
              Lucas Champollion, Mitcho Erlewine, Valentine Hacquard, and Mary Moroney. Its committee membership consists 
              of its chair (the SALT Diversity Coordinator, an elected position) and several committee members, chosen by 
              the chair and ideally including at least one student, serving staggered two-year terms.
